You must use Skill('ship:review'). Skip preamble and auth gate.

Review the current diff against the spec. Write findings to the path below.

IMPORTANT: You MUST write your findings to .ship/tasks/roadmap-md-4-tianshu-integrations-phase-2-6-week-1-4-qa-mini/review.md even if the
review is clean (write a short "no findings" report). The orchestrator reads
this file to decide the next phase — if it's missing, the pipeline stalls.
Do NOT only output findings to the conversation; the file is the artifact.

Report card Status rules:
- Zero P1/P2 findings → Status: PASS
- Any P1 or P2 findings → Status: FINDINGS (even if everything else is good)
P2s are real issues that the pipeline must fix. Only P3s are advisory.
